   <p> I'm 11, I was born on april 15th back in 2007, and I'm an Aries Sun/Pisces Moon/Sagittarius Ascendant! </p>
   <p> I live in alaska with my dad who was in jail once for several counts of aggravated assult and 'possession of several illegal substances' whatever that means </p>
   <p> My dad is super cool! he has a big motorcycle and he's the most hugest man in town and I once saw him break a man's neck with his elbow! That guy is dead now! </p>
   <p> I can run my middle school with an iron fist because I can crush anyone who messes with me like a grape, so don't play with me!</p>
   <p> I have 9 brothers and 5 sisters, but I only know like..3 of them. </p>
   <p> I love red , My favorite TV shows are Boise Medical & Divorce Deathmatch, And my favorite food is extra cheesy pizza with ketchup & chocolate chips!
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLDLusWXBI"> This is one of my all time most favoritest songs!</a>
   <p> My hobbies include playing with my dollies, throwing rotting apples at people's houses, and challenging 8th graders to fight me in the pit (the dumpster behind the gym)</p>
